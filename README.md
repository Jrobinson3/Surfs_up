# Surfs_up
## Deliverable
1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the new surf shop will be opened in Oahu, Hawaii.  In order to analyze the data, we used Hawaii SQLite, specifically temperatures of the months June and December to determine that the surf shop will be successful in Hawaii. 

2. Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
1) 1) High temperatures in June and December are similar to each other in which they are 83 and 85.  
2) Average temperatures in June and December are also similar to each other in which they are 74 and 71. 
3) ![image](https://github.com/Jrobinson3/Surfs_up/blob/main/June_temps.PNG)
4) 3) The surf shop will be sustainable all year round since max temperate  is over 80 in all year round.

3. Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
Looking at the temperatures for mid-year and end-year, the surf shop could be successful if they open in Oahu. The comparison by previous year was not done in this analysis, but it could be more realizable to say the surf shop will definitely successful if we get the similar temperature data from the previous year. 
Addtionally visualize the results to show these results would have been benefit to persuade the investors.
